How are you guys doing? I have been trying to send this since Monday.

- Please focus on 802.1x authentication
    - PEAP authentication for wired user.
        -    User authentication for wired domain user
        -    Machine authentication for domain user

You will need to create the authc and authz rules in ISE. Switch configurations too. You will need to configure the supplicant(MS native supplicant or Cisco anyconnect NAM).

Please let me know if this makes sense.
